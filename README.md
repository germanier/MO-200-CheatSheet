# Microsoft Office Specialist: Excel Associate (Excel and Excel 2019) - Cheatsheet
The plan for this repository is to create a comprehensive-ish cheatcheet for the MO-200 / Excel 2019 Associate Exam.

The automatic program checking what you've done is lacking, to say the least. Though there's multiple ways of carrying out the tasks, it seems to only accept your work if you suffer through the ribbon menues (who thought of this a brilliant idea? 🤦). 

Hence why I make a start on this list. Do help out if there's some I missed. 👍

Mike's Office videos are also pretty good: https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC92eTyKmq0zOIjIK1ShycKw
